For RPM based distros (Fedora, Redhat, CentOS and Amazon Linux AMI), the configuration mentioned in the repo should work. Additional steps may be needed, though. See below for some details!

## How to Deploy

For all the steps mentioned below, you need __sudo__ or __root__ privileges!

Step #1 - Install Nginx

You may use the official Nginx repo or just use the Nginx package that comes with the OS. Both would work fine! I will leave the decision to you. Since, the installation process varies across Operating Systems, please refer the official installation guide to complete this step.

Step #2 - Please backup your existing configuration files. Probably, have /etc under version control!

```bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%F_%H-%M-%S)
mkdir $HOME/nginx-backup-$TIMESTAMP
sudo cp -a /etc/nginx $HOME/nginx-backup-$TIMESTAMP
```

Step #3 - Copy this repo to your server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pothi/wordpress-nginx.git $HOME/git/wordpress-nginx
sudo cp -a $HOME/git/wordpress-nginx/* /etc/nginx/
sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/sites-enabled &> /dev/null
sudo cp /etc/nginx/nginx-sample.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```
Further steps varies depending on your particular requirement:

+ you may edit /etc/nginx/conf.d/lb.conf and update the upstream block for 'fpm' (one-off process)
+ then you may do the following for each vhost, depending on your environment...
```bash
WP_DOMAIN=example.com
WP_ROOT=/path/to/wordpress/for/example.com
sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/$WP_DOMAIN.conf
sudo sed -i 's:/home/username/sites/example.com/public:'$WP_ROOT':gp' /etc/nginx/sites-available/$WP_DOMAIN.conf
sudo sed -i 's/example.com/'$WP_DOMAIN'/g' /etc/nginx/sites-available/$WP_DOMAIN.conf
cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo ln -s ../sites-available/$WP_DOMAIN.conf
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Changes on CentOS (and on rpm based distros in general)

CentOS has a different file naming convention, yet simple directory structure, when compared to Debian derivatives. Let me describe them and I'd let you decide upon how you'd want to structure your files and name those files.

+ The configuration for default sites are named as `default.conf` and `ssl.conf` in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`.
+ There is no `sites-available` or `sites-enabled` folder.
+ The file `/etc/nginx/fastcgi_params` in Debian is named as `/etc/nginx/fastcgi.conf` in CentOS.
